# simple nodejs app

This repository is a simple React app for me to practice and use for reference as an example.

Note: These examples call the developer versions of the React libraries from <script> tags
in the HTML page head section -- this is not the recommended approach for production, it is
only used so that these examples can be run quickly with only a web browser.

## Project Structure

- 00hello_world.html : A simple hello_world React example
- 01basics.html : A React example showing basics of writing React components with lots of source code comment explanatoins
- 02lists.html : A React example looping through data to generate a list
- 03states.html : A React example showing how to use event handlers and states
- README.md : The README file.
- index.html : A Table of contents of the other pages, it is also done in React too for fun.
